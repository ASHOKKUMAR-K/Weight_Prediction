# Weight_Prediction
- It is an End to End Data Science project using Linear Regression Machine Learning model API which will predict the weight in kilograms for height input given in the web interface. 
- The web interface was done using Flask framework.
- Here, I had used a Simple Linear Regression model to predict the weight in kgs for the given height input in centimeters.
